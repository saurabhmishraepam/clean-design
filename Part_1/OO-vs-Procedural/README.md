# Practical task repository for Complex Task

## General Task Guidelines

*	Please fork the repository to your EPAM GitLab account and make corrections per the principles/topics discussed so far in this course . 
*	The task repository may contain one or more than one practical task per given topic, you are expected to complete all the tasks.
*	Tasks are Java based and it is NOT mandatory to use the latest language versions while making code updates.
*	It is recommended that you complete the practical tasks for a topic before proceeding to the next topics.
*	A task/subtopic will be considered as complete after all the review comments are incorporated from the below mentioned review process.
*	While making changes, any files contained inside package named as 'thirdpartyjars' should be ignored. These file are meant to provide context to the task and are not part of the task.
*	Some tasks have unit tests implemented, if they exist, they are comprehensive and we are free to change production code in any way until tests are green. You may add more tests if you feel appropriate but this is not expected.
*   The goal is not to implement new features, but to refactor of existing code, according to principles you have just learnt. It is mean that all unit tests are green in the beginning and they should remain green after you finish.



## Task Specific guidelines

```
*	This task contains different data structures (like Zone, Aperture, Worker, Assignment etc.) and algorithms to calculate the amount of money required to perform some job by some worker.
You should analyze is it correct approach to use data structures here?
Is it more likely a new function going to be added to the all data structures, or is it more likely a new type going to be added/changed.
Refactor the code according to the principles you have just learnt.
